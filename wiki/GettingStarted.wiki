#Getting started guide

*Introduction:*

The aim of gwt calendar is to provide a gwt jar that contains the java Calendar class.  We've currently extracted 

*Details:*

Download the jar and add the following line in your gwt.xml file:

<inherits name='com.spiral.gwt-calendar' />

*Warning:*

At the moment, you'll have to use the GWTCalendar class.  We will be switching to use java.util.Calendar in the near future.  I wouldn't recommend this project for consumption yet, it's in alpha status.
