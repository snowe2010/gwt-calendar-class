#Getting started guide

**Introduction:**

The aim of gwt calendar is to provide a gwt jar that contains the java Calendar class.  We've currently extracted

**Details:**

Download the jar and add the following line in your gwt.xml file:

```
<inherits name='com.spiral.gwt-calendar' />
```

**Warning:**

The jar is in alpha right now, I think core functionality should work fine.  The locale class doesn't have any methods implemented, it's there for compatibility reasons.  If you have any issues please contact me at artie.motamed@gmail.com.

Thanks,
Artie
